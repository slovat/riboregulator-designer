NUPACK must be installed for riboregulator designer to work. NUPACK is easiest to install and runs the most reliably on linux. For windows users, use windows subsystem 
for linux to install NUPACK (instructions for how to install windows subsystem for linux can be found here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Do 
not try to install NUPACK directly on windows, even NUPACK3.0.6 using Cygwin.

We have built and tested Riboregulator Designer using NUPACK 3.2.2 which can be downloaded from: http://www.nupack.org/downloads (note you must first obtain a license 
through this page before you can download NUPACK).
 
Follow the NUPACK user guide instructions to install NUPACK (see documentation for NUPACK 3.2, installation instructions can be found on page 41).

Riboregulator Designer has been written and tested in python 3. A python kernel in Jupyter Notebook can be used to run the .ipynb script, alternatively, python can be 
used from the terminal to run the .py script (the .ipynb and .py are the same).
